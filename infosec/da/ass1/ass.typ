= P2P Chat App

#cblock[
A peer to peer chat application which is end to end
encrypted and does not require login to ensure complete user privacy\

== Algorithm Description
- Uses Iroh/QUIC for encrypted transport.
- Asynchronous tasks handle connections and messages.
- Event Driven Architecture

*There are 4 core events:*\
1. Create Chat Room:
    1.  Get/Generate Secret Key.
    2.  Create Iroh Endpoint (with key, ALPN).
    3.  Bind Endpoint.
    4.  Get Node Address (from relay).
    5.  Create NodeTicket.
    6.  *Async Task:* Accept connection, bi-directional stream. Read/Verify Handshake.
    7. *Async Task:* Read messages, emit "new-message" event. Store SendStream in ChatState.

2. Join Chat Room:
    1.  Parse NodeTicket.
    2.  Get/Generate Secret Key.
    3.  Create Iroh Endpoint
    4.  Bind Endpoint.
    5.  Connect to peer (using NodeID).
    6.  Open bi-directional stream. Send Handshake.
    7.  *Async Task:* Read messages, emit "new-message" event. Store SendStream in ChatState.

3. Send Message:
    1.  Lock ChatState.
    2.  Lock SendStream (from ChatSession).
    3.  Write message to SendStream.
    4.  Release Locks.

4. Receiving a Message:
    1.  Read from RecvStream: Asynchronously read data from the `RecvStream` of the established bi-directional QUIC stream.
    2.  Decode received bytes to to string.
    3.  Emit Tauri Event for emit a "new-message" event.
    4.  The frontend is subscribed to the "new-message" event. Upon receiving the event, the frontend updates the UI.
    5.  Loop: Repeat steps 1-4 to continuously listen for new messages on the stream.

== Information Security
The implementation is fundamentally based on information security and
the CIA Triad:


-   *Confidentiality:* Use of TLS encryption, protecting the confidentiality of data in transit. The use of `SecretKey` and `PublicKey` pairs ensures that only the intended recipient can decrypt the data.

-   *Integrity:* QUIC provides built-in integrity protection through its authenticated encryption.

-   *Availability:* The combination of P2P architecture, QUIC's resilience to network changes, and the use of relay servers as a fallback mechanism enhances availability.

-   *Authenticity:* QUIC provides strong *peer* authentication. The connecting node verifies the identity of the other node using its `PublicKey` (NodeId).

-   *Accountability:* Requires user authentication as a prerequisite.

-   *Privacy:* Encryption protects the content.
