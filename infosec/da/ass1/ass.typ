= Chat App

#cblock[
A chat application which is end to end
encrypted and does not require login to ensure complete user privacy\
\
*Code*: #link("https://github.com/mav3ri3k/p2p-chat")[https://github.com/mav3ri3k/p2p-chat]
]

== Stack / Technical Coverage
- *Full Stack*: The project covers both frontend (UI, user interaction) and backend (networking, state management) development.
- *Frontend Stack*: React, TypeScript, Vite, Deno - a modern web technology stack.
- *Backend Stack*: Rust, Tokio (async runtime), iroh (P2P networking library based on QUIC).
- *Integration Framework*: Tauri is used effectively to bridge the Rust backend and the web frontend, handling inter-process communication and packaging the application for desktop use.
- *Networking Layer*: Utilizes QUIC via iroh and defines a simple application-layer protocol on top.

== Module Contributions
Implementation of core backend logic and communication.\

1. *Backend Core & Networking*:

    - Implemented the core P2P connection logic using the iroh Rust library.
    - Developed the node setup, binding, and connection establishment mechanisms for both creating ("hosting") and joining chat rooms via NodeTickets.
    - Managed the asynchronous tasks for accepting connections, handling handshakes, and continuously reading incoming messages from the peer.
    - Implemented the backend state management (ChatState) to hold the active connection's send stream.
2. *Tauri Framework Integration*:
    - Configured the Tauri application structure, including build settings (tauri.conf.json) and Rust dependencies (Cargo.toml).
    - Defined and implemented the Tauri commands (create_chat_room, join_chat_room, send_message) to expose backend functionality to the frontend.
    - Utilized Tauri's state management (tauri::State) to share the ChatState across command handlers.
    - Implemented the event emission (app_handle.emit("new-message", ...)) from the backend to notify the frontend of incoming messages.

== Knowledge Gained

- *Rust & Asynchronous Programming*: The backend is written in Rust, utilizing Tokio for asynchronous operations, which is essential for handling network I/O non-blockingly
- *P2P Networking*: The project uses the iroh library for establishing peer-to-peer connections over QUIC.
- *Tauri Framework*: Integrating a Rust backend with a web frontend (React/TypeScript) using Tauri which allows for cross-platform applications.
- *Frontend Technologies*: Use of React with TypeScript, Vite for bundling, and managing dependencies, and Deno as javascript runtime.

== Algorithm Description
- Uses Iroh/QUIC for encrypted transport.
- Asynchronous tasks handle connections and messages.
- Event Driven Architecture

*There are 4 core events:*\
1. Create Chat Room:
    1.  Get/Generate Secret Key.
    2.  Create Iroh Endpoint (with key, ALPN).
    3.  Bind Endpoint.
    4.  Get Node Address (from relay).
    5.  Create NodeTicket.
    6.  *Async Task:* Accept connection, bi-directional stream. Read/Verify Handshake.
    7. *Async Task:* Read messages, emit "new-message" event. Store SendStream in ChatState.

2. Join Chat Room:
    1.  Parse NodeTicket.
    2.  Get/Generate Secret Key.
    3.  Create Iroh Endpoint
    4.  Bind Endpoint.
    5.  Connect to peer (using NodeID).
    6.  Open bi-directional stream. Send Handshake.
    7.  *Async Task:* Read messages, emit "new-message" event. Store SendStream in ChatState.

3. Send Message:
    1.  Lock ChatState.
    2.  Lock SendStream (from ChatSession).
    3.  Write message to SendStream.
    4.  Release Locks.

4. Receiving a Message:
    1.  Read from RecvStream: Asynchronously read data from the `RecvStream` of the established bi-directional QUIC stream.
    2.  Decode received bytes to to string.
    3.  Emit Tauri Event for emit a "new-message" event.
    4.  The frontend is subscribed to the "new-message" event. Upon receiving the event, the frontend updates the UI.
    5.  Loop: Repeat steps 1-4 to continuously listen for new messages on the stream.

== Output
#image("output.png")
== Information Security
The implementation is fundamentally based on information security and
the CIA Triad:


-   *Confidentiality:* Use of TLS encryption, protecting the confidentiality of data in transit. The use of `SecretKey` and `PublicKey` pairs ensures that only the intended recipient can decrypt the data.

-   *Integrity:* QUIC provides built-in integrity protection through its authenticated encryption.

-   *Availability:* The combination of P2P architecture, QUIC's resilience to network changes, and the use of relay servers as a fallback mechanism enhances availability.

-   *Authenticity:* QUIC provides strong *peer* authentication. The connecting node verifies the identity of the other node using its `PublicKey` (NodeId).

-   *Accountability:* Requires user authentication as a prerequisite.

-   *Privacy:* Encryption protects the content.
