Language is simple because it's sequence of discrete symbole. There are only finite number of discrete words in the dictionary.

So, we can train it to predict an probability of every word in the dictionary to appear at that location.
So we can handle the uncertaility in the prediction that way.

**This seems similar to encoder only models. Task such as classification
inherently mititagetes against uncertianity due to discrete classes.** 

The space of discrete objects and symbols is easily minipulated by computer, but real world is quite complex.
