= Module 1
*Marks: 10*
  - Discuss Models
  - Hierarchy Aspect
  - Relevant Technologies

== Limitations of CIoT (Cloud to Edge): BLURS
- Bandwidth
- Latency
- Uninterpted Connectivity
- Resource Constraint (Power)
- Security

== Advantages of Fog
- Hierarchial
- Flexible
- Scalable

== Cloudlet Computing
Smaller Compute Resources compared to data centres deployed closer to edge
resources aimed for mobile applications with lower latency.
(Cluster of small data centers generally one hop away)

== Virtualisation ??

== Mist Computing ??

== Advantages of Fog and Edge Computing: SCALE
- Security
- Cognition
- Agility
- Latency
- Efficiency

== What FEC Provide
- Storage: Cache
- Compute: VM
- Acceleration: FPGA/GPU
- Networking: TCP/UDP (Vertical Networking), Bluetooth/Zigbee (Horizontal Networking)
- Control: Deployment, Actuation

== Hierarchy
- Core Network
- Inner Edge: LAN
- Middle Edge: Fog
- Outer Edge: Sensors and Actuators

== Buinses Models
- X as service (XaaS): Provide hardware, infrastrucre, software as service
- Application: Efficient Data Processing, or solutions to a problem
- Support

== Challenges
- Vendor Lockin
- Vertical Integration across all the layers
- Security Risks
- Increased Complexity
- Interoperability across hardware acrsos the layers
- Limited Support

= Module 2
*10 Marks*
- C2F2T: Uses Casess & Metrics
- Formulas


== Federated Edge Resources
Process of sharing and connecting resources at the edge of network.


=== Challenges
1. Networking
  Software Defined Network *(SDN)* is potential solution for orchestrating edge resources.

2. Management
  Rapid service migration between nodes cause high overhead and unsuitability.
