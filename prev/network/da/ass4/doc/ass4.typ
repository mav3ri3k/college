  Explain TCP and UDP with socket programming concept.

= TCP Socket Programming
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that a connection is established and maintained until the application programs at each end have finished exchanging messages. It provides reliable and ordered delivery of data packets.

The key features of TCP:
- TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that a connection is established and maintained until the application programs at each end have finished exchanging messages.
- The server creates a socket, binds it to a specific port, and listens for incoming connections.
- The client creates a socket and connects to the server's socket.
- The server and client can then exchange data through the established connection.
- The server and client must handle the connection lifecycle, including opening, using, and closing the connection.


= UDP Socket Programming


UDP is a connectionless protocol, which means that there is no need to establish a connection before sending data. It provides unreliable and unordered delivery of data packets.

The key features of UDP:
- UDP is a connectionless protocol, which means that there is no need to establish a connection before sending data.
- The server creates a socket, binds it to a specific port, and listens for incoming messages.
- The client creates a socket and sends messages to the server's socket.
- The server and client can exchange data, but there is no guarantee that the data will be delivered or arrive in the correct order.
- The server and client do not need to handle the connection lifecycle, as there is no connection to maintain.

= Difference between TCP and UDP
The main differences between TCP and UDP socket programming in C:

1. Connection-oriented vs. Connectionless:\
  TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that a connection is established and maintained until the application programs at each end have finished exchanging messages.
  UDP is a connectionless protocol, which means that there is no need to establish a connection before sending data.


2. Reliability and Ordering:\
  TCP provides reliable and ordered delivery of data packets.
  UDP provides unreliable and unordered delivery of data packets.


3. Connection Lifecycle:\
  In TCP, the server and client must handle the connection lifecycle, including opening, using, and closing the connection.
  In UDP, the server and client do not need to handle the connection lifecycle, as there is no connection to maintain.
