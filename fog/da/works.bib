abstract = {Next generation communication networks are expected to accommodate a high number of new and resource-voracious applications that can be offered to a large range of end users. Even though end devices are becoming more powerful, the available local resources cannot cope with the requirements of these applications. This has created a new challenge called task offloading, where computation intensive tasks need to be offloaded to more resource powerful remote devices. Naturally, the Cloud Computing is a well-tested infrastructure that can facilitate the task offloading. However, Cloud Computing as a centralized and distant infrastructure creates significant communication delays that cannot satisfy the requirements of the emerging delay-sensitive applications. To this end, the concept of Edge Computing has been proposed, where the Cloud Computing capabilities are repositioned closer to the end devices at the edge of the network. This paper provides a detailed survey of how the Edge and/or Cloud can be combined together to facilitate the task offloading problem. Particular emphasis is given on the mathematical, artificial intelligence and control theory optimization approaches that can be used to satisfy the various objectives, constraints and dynamic conditions of this end-to-end application execution approach. The survey concludes with identifying open challenges and future directions of the problem at hand.}

abstract = {Edge computing places the computational services and resources closer to the user proximity, to reduce latency, and ensure the quality of service and experience. Low latency, context awareness and mobility support are the major contributors to edge-enabled smart systems. Such systems require handling new situations and change on the fly and ensuring the quality of service while only having access to constrained computation and communication resources and operating in mobile, dynamic and ever-changing environments. Hence, adaptation and self-organisation are crucial for such systems to maintain their performance, and operability while accommodating new changes in their environment.This article reviews the current literature in the field of adaptive edge computing systems. We use a widely accepted taxonomy, which describes the important aspects of adaptive behaviour implementation in computing systems. This taxonomy discusses aspects such as adaptation reasons, the various levels an adaptation strategy can be implemented, the time of reaction to a change, categories of adaptation technique and control of the adaptive behaviour. In this article, we discuss how these aspects are addressed in the literature and identify the open research challenges and future direction in adaptive edge computing systems.The results of our analysis show that most of the identified approaches target adaptation at the application level, and only a few focus on middleware, communication infrastructure and context. Adaptations that are required to address the changes in the context, changes caused by users or in the system itself are also less explored. Furthermore, most of the literature has opted for reactive adaptation, although proactive adaptation is essential to maintain the edge computing systems’ performance and interoperability by anticipating the required adaptations on the fly. Additionally, most approaches apply a centralised adaptation control, which does not perfectly fit the mostly decentralised/distributed edge computing settings.},

abstract = {Abstract The advent of edge computing holds immense promise for advancing the digitization of society, ushering in critical applications that elevate the overall quality of life. Yet, the practical implementation of the edge paradigm proves more challenging than anticipated, encountering disruptions primarily due to the constraints of applying conventional cloud-based strategies at the network's periphery. Increasingly influenced by sustainability commitments, industry regulations currently view edge computing as a potential threat, primarily due to the energy inefficiency of solutions situated in close proximity to data generation sources and the rising density of computing. This paper presents a proactive strategy to transform the perceived threat into an opportunity, steering the sustainable evolution of future edge infrastructures to make them both environmentally and economically competitive for accelerated adoption. The vision outlined addresses key challenges associated with edge deployment and operation, emphasizing energy efficiency, fault-tolerant automation, and collaborative orchestration. The proposed approach integrates two-phase immersion cooling, formal modeling, machine learning, and federated management to effectively harness heterogeneity, propelling the sustainability of edge computing. To substantiate the efficacy of this approach, the paper details initial efforts towards establishing the sustainability of an edge infrastructure designed for an Advanced Driver Assistance Systems application.},

ABSTRACT = {With the advancement of different technologies such as 5G networks and IoT the use of different cloud computing technologies became essential. Cloud computing allowed intensive data processing and warehousing solution. Two different new cloud technologies that inherit some of the traditional cloud computing paradigm are fog computing and edge computing that is aims to simplify some of the complexity of cloud computing and leverage the computing capabilities within the local network in order to preform computation tasks rather than carrying it to the cloud. This makes this technology fits with the properties of IoT systems. However, using such technology introduces several new security and privacy challenges that could be huge obstacle against implementing these technologies. In this paper, we survey some of the main security and privacy challenges that faces fog and edge computing illustrating how these security issues could affect the work and implementation of edge and fog computing. Moreover, we present several countermeasures to mitigate the effect of these security issues.},

ABSTRACT = {The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things ecosystem has created an urgent need for efficient data processing and analysis technologies. This review aims to systematically examine and compare edge computing, cloud computing, and hybrid architectures, focusing on their applications within IoT environments. The methodology involved a comprehensive search and analysis of peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, and industry reports, highlighting recent advancements in computing technologies for IoT. Key findings reveal that edge computing excels in reducing latency and enhancing data privacy through localized processing, while cloud computing offers superior scalability and flexibility. Hybrid approaches, such as fog and mist computing, present a promising solution by combining the strengths of both edge and cloud systems. These hybrid models optimize bandwidth use and support low-latency, privacy-sensitive applications in IoT ecosystems. Hybrid architectures are identified as particularly effective for scenarios requiring efficient bandwidth management and low-latency processing. These models represent a significant step forward in addressing the limitations of both edge and cloud computing for IoT, offering a balanced approach to data analysis and resource management.},
